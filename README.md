## Blackjack Tech Test - Grace Richardson

This code is an extension of the starter code provided.

### Introduction
- To run the code
    - If you have Python 3 installed:
        - Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder containing this README.
        - Type `python3 blackjack.py`
        - Play game in terminal
- To run the unit tests
    - From the same terminal window, type `python3 -m unittest discover test`.
    - Python should find and run  10 Tests, these tests are based on the scenarios provided, with an additional 2 tests for further edge cases. 
    

### Log of Workflow
- In the design folder there is a text file called `workflow_log.txt`
- In this file is a log of my approach with explanations of each stage and my process. 


### Future Sprint Goals 
#### Big Goals
- I would like to scale up the play method to allow for multiple decks and multiple players
- I would like to add a UI, to improve the user experience
- I would like to incorporate a betting system 
- I would like to allow for multiple games to be played per 'session', perhaps even adding a backend to store data across plays
#### Quick Wins
- I would like to add a class diagram aid my code's readability 
- I would like to further modularise my hit method, at the moment there is a large difference between the used in testing and those used in my play() method. If I were to scale up the code the way it is now, there would be alot more work needed per test, so this would increase my efficiency in the longterm
- I would like to mockup a UI in Adobe XD
